        <h2>Introduction to Islam</h2>
        <p>
            Islam is a divine religion revealed by Allah Almighty for the guidance
            of all mankind. The word Islam comes from the Arabic root word “Salam”,
            which means peace, safety, and submission. Islam teaches that true peace
            can only be achieved by submitting oneself completely to the will of Allah.
        </p>

        <p>
            From the beginning of human history, Allah sent prophets to guide people
            towards the right path. Prophet Muhammad ﷺ is the final messenger, and
            the Quran is the final revealed book that remains unchanged till today.
        </p>

        <h2>The Concept of Tawheed (Oneness of Allah)</h2>
        <p>
            The foundation of Islam is Tawheed, which means believing in the Oneness
            of Allah. Muslims believe that Allah is the Creator, Sustainer, and
            Controller of the universe. He has no partners, no children, and no equals.
        </p>

        <p>
            Tawheed gives clarity to human life. It frees a person from worshipping
            false gods, humans, or desires and connects the heart directly with Allah.
        </p>

        <h2>The Holy Quran – A Book of Guidance</h2>
        <p>
            The Holy Quran is the last divine book revealed to Prophet Muhammad ﷺ
            through Angel Jibreel. It is not only a religious book but a complete
            guide for life that addresses spiritual, moral, social, and legal matters.
        </p>

        <p>
            The Quran emphasizes justice, mercy, patience, honesty, and kindness.
            It teaches how to build a balanced society where the rights of every
            individual are protected.
        </p>

        <h2>The Life of Prophet Muhammad ﷺ</h2>
        <p>
            Prophet Muhammad ﷺ is the best example for humanity. His life is a model
            of mercy, forgiveness, patience, and wisdom. Even his enemies testified
            to his honesty and noble character.
        </p>

        <p>
            By following the Sunnah of the Prophet ﷺ, Muslims learn how to live
            a life pleasing to Allah and beneficial for society.
        </p>
        <h2>Faith (Iman) in Islam</h2>

<p>
Faith, known as Iman in Islam, is the core of a Muslim’s belief system.
It is not limited to verbal declaration but is deeply connected with
the heart and reflected through actions. Islam teaches that true faith
brings inner peace, moral strength, and a clear purpose in life.
</p>

<p>
Iman is built upon complete trust in Allah and acceptance of His divine
guidance. A believer understands that everything in this universe
happens by the will of Allah and that every event carries wisdom,
whether visible or hidden.
</p>

<h3>The Six Pillars of Faith</h3>

<p>
Islam clearly defines the foundations of faith through six essential
beliefs. These pillars shape a Muslim’s worldview and guide their
thoughts, decisions, and actions.
</p>

<p>
<strong>1. Belief in Allah:</strong><br>
Muslims believe in Allah as the One and Only Creator. He is Eternal,
All-Powerful, and Most Merciful. Belief in Allah gives humans dignity
and frees them from fear of creation, as they rely solely on their
Creator.
</p>

<p>
<strong>2. Belief in Angels:</strong><br>
Angels are noble creations of Allah made from light. They perform
specific duties, such as delivering revelation, recording deeds, and
protecting believers. Belief in angels strengthens awareness that every
action is observed.
</p>

<p>
<strong>3. Belief in Divine Books:</strong><br>
Allah revealed guidance to humanity through holy books. These include
the Torah, Psalms, Gospel, and finally the Holy Quran. Muslims believe
that the Quran is the final and preserved word of Allah.
</p>

<p>
<strong>4. Belief in Prophets:</strong><br>
Allah sent prophets to guide humanity. From Adam to Muhammad ﷺ, all
prophets preached the same message: worship Allah alone and live a
righteous life. Prophet Muhammad ﷺ is the final messenger.
</p>

<p>
<strong>5. Belief in the Day of Judgment:</strong><br>
Islam teaches accountability. Every soul will be judged based on faith
and deeds. This belief encourages justice, honesty, patience, and
responsibility in daily life.
</p>

<p>
<strong>6. Belief in Divine Decree (Qadr):</strong><br>
Muslims believe that everything happens by Allah’s knowledge and will.
This belief creates balance — encouraging effort while accepting
outcomes with patience and trust in Allah’s wisdom.
</p>

<h3>Impact of Faith on Human Life</h3>

<p>
True faith transforms a person from within. It creates humility,
gratitude, and compassion. A believer avoids injustice, lies, and harm
because they are conscious of Allah’s presence at all times.
</p>

<p>
Faith also provides emotional strength during hardship. When faced with
loss, pain, or uncertainty, a believer finds comfort in prayer and trust
in Allah’s plan. This spiritual connection protects the heart from
despair and hopelessness.
</p>

<p>
In Islam, faith and action go hand in hand. A strong believer is not
only devoted in worship but also kind to parents, neighbors, the poor,
and even animals. Thus, faith becomes a source of benefit for the entire
society.
